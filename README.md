# About this code

This repository contains the source code for the Visual Studio Code extension "codehelper". This extension serves as a starting point and proof of concept for how one can recreate a GitHub Copilot-like extension using the open-source model deepseek-coder:1.5b.

## Purpose

The primary goal of this extension is to demonstrate the capabilities of the deepseek-coder:1.5b model in providing intelligent code suggestions and assistance within the Visual Studio Code environment. It aims to replicate some of the functionalities of GitHub Copilot using an open-source approach.

## Testing the Extension

1. Open the project in Visual Studio Code:
   ```sh
   code .
   ```
2. Press `F5` to start debugging. This will open a new VS Code window with the extension loaded.
3. In the new window, open the command palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P` or `Cmd+Shift+P` on Mac) and run the command `codehelper.codehelper-ext` to open the CodeHelper Chat panel.
4. In the CodeHelper Chat panel, enter a prompt in the text area and click the "Send" button.
5. The extension will use the deepseek-coder:1.3b model to generate a response, which will be displayed in the panel. Screenshots below on the current experience.
